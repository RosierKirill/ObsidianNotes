#### Overview: Project “Delta”

Delta-09, codenamed Torpedo, is an advanced genetically modified operative specializing in aquatic operations. Engineered with genetic enhancements derived from dolphins, whales, and orcas, Torpedo’s abilities place him at the apex of underwater combat. With unparalleled speed and resilience in water, he has executed numerous high-stakes missions, including the neutralization of enemy submarines and warships. His name, "Torpedo," was earned after achieving an unprecedented underwater speed of 400 km/h during one such mission.

#### Technological Equipment

- Aquatic Combat Suit ("Kinos AQS-09"):  
    Developed by MANS R&D, this dark blue and black suit is optimized for underwater environments.  
      
    

- Material Composition:
    

- Multi-layer Kevlar and graphene nanotubes for durability.
    
- Titanium plating for impact resistance.
    
- Adaptive hydro-dynamic design to minimize drag.
    

- Key Features:
    

- Breathing System: Integrated oxygen filtration and storage, providing up to 6 hours of autonomy underwater.
    
- Cooling System: Maintains body temperature in extreme hot or cold aquatic environments.
    
- Skin Hydration: Embedded nano-sprayers ensure skin moisture retention on land.
    
- Enhanced Strength Mechanisms: Hydraulically assisted arms and legs amplify physical strikes to penetrate armor or reinforced hulls.
    

- Weaponry:  
      
    

- Torpedo rarely utilizes conventional weaponry due to his natural combat efficiency.
    
- When necessary, he wields a Horizon G9 Waterproof Rifle, chambered for 7.62 mm armor-piercing rounds, with an integrated harpoon launcher for underwater scenarios.

#### Combat Tactics

Torpedo is a master of aquatic guerrilla warfare, using his speed and agility to overwhelm targets. His effectiveness is heightened in team operations, where he acts as both a scout and a heavy-hitter. He is particularly adept at ambushing enemy vessels, penetrating hulls, and sabotaging systems before surfacing. On land, his mobility decreases, but his strength and adaptability allow him to perform in amphibious missions.

- Underwater Combat:  
    His ability to accelerate to 400 km/h enables him to ram into enemy structures with devastating force. His suit’s hydraulics further amplify the power of his punches and kicks, making him a formidable opponent even without weapons.

#### Behavioral Aspects

Jonathan displays traits reminiscent of large marine mammals:

- Empathy: High levels of emotional intelligence and a strong sense of loyalty to his team.
    
- Motivation: Extremely goal-driven, often pushing himself beyond limits to complete missions.
    
- Teamwork: Performs best with a mission partner, demonstrating exceptional synchronization and cooperative skills.
    

While highly disciplined, he exhibits moments of isolationism, possibly linked to his enhanced instincts and connection to water-based environments.

#### Operational Recommendations:

1. Deploy in aquatic environments: Torpedo’s abilities peak in water, making him indispensable for underwater sabotage, reconnaissance, and rescue operations.
    
2. Pair with a teammate: His effectiveness increases significantly in coordinated team scenarios.
    
3. Monitor terrestrial conditions: Prolonged operations on land may require additional hydration and suit maintenance to prevent skin dehydration.
